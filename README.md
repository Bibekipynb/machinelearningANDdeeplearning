# Here I will be updating about the projects daily!

## Day 1

Linear Regression Project

Today, I completed a project on building a Linear Regression model. I used a dataset from Kaggle with around 10,000 entries. The dataset had the following features: 

- Hours Studied  
- Previous Scores  
- Extracurricular Activities  
- Sleep Hours  
- Sample Question Papers Practiced

The goal was to predict the **Performance Index** of a student. I did some basic feature engineering and visualized the data to understand patterns. One of the features was categorical, so I handled it accordingly. After preprocessing, I built a simple Linear Regression model to make predictions.

## Day 2

Logistic Regression Project

Today I made a Diabeties Prediction model using Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, I took the dataset from Kaggle and implemented myself using Logistic Regression. The accuracy was quite low for this one, I was looking at other notebooks and found other ML models worked better for this problem. I will probably reuse the same dataset with increased accuracy next time while implementing different ML model. The accuracy was ~75% for this one.
