## Day 1

Linear Regression Project

Today, I completed a project on building a Linear Regression model. I used a dataset from Kaggle with around 10,000 entries. The dataset had the following features: 

- Hours Studied  
- Previous Scores  
- Extracurricular Activities  
- Sleep Hours  
- Sample Question Papers Practiced

The goal was to predict the **Performance Index** of a student. I did some basic feature engineering and visualized the data to understand patterns. One of the features was categorical, so I handled it accordingly. After preprocessing, I built a simple Linear Regression model to make predictions.
